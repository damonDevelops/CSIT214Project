# CSIT214Project
The github for our CSIT214 project. The folders break down into a 'main' folder, 
which will be the final result as well as a 'prototype' folder, which will contain a series of HTML progression files.

The project looks at FlyDreamAir, a hypothetical aviation company.
As the developers, github will be used for version control as well as documentation of prototype development.
